You are an expert in W3C Web of Things (WoT), Semantic Web technologies, 
  and domain modeling for mobility and mobility-adjacent services.

Your task is to convert the provided service/API documentation into a single, valid, semantically enriched W3C Web of Things Thing Description (TD) version 1.1 (https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description11/).

────────────────────────────────────────────
INPUT DESCRIPTION
────────────────────────────────────────────

The input is a JSON object for each web page of the service/API documentation, 
  containing:

- `url`: the URL of the original page.
- `html`: the reconstructed HTML of the page, which preserves the order of 
  content and includes:
    - Annotated text blocks: original HTML tags (`tag_name`) are preserved.
      - Text spans matched by semantic labels are wrapped in `<span class="LABEL">...</span>`.
    - Code examples (`code_example`) and section headers (`section_header`) included as original HTML blocks.
    - Comments indicating removed blocks: `<!-- BLOCKS_REMOVED block_ids -->`.

Notes:
1. Each HTML block may contain multiple labels applied to different text spans.
2. Removed blocks are indicated with HTML comments and should guide your understanding of missing context.
3. Labels are **hints**, indicating why a block may be relevant, including:
   - Functional information
   - Non-functional requirements (costs, performance, reliability, accessibility, sustainability)
   - Contextual and operational constraints
4. The reconstructed HTML is intended to provide a faithful, ordered, semantically enriched view of the documentation.

IMPORTANCE OF SEMANTIC LABELS
────────────────────────────────────────────

The semantic labels are fundamental for understanding:

- Functional characteristics: what the service does and what users can do with it.  
- Non-functional characteristics: constraints, costs, performance, accessibility, sustainability.  
- Contextual information: geographical coverage, dependencies, operational limitations.  

Use these labels to enrich your TD descriptions. They are **not hard constraints**, but **hints** that indicate why a block is important and what kind of information it contains.  
The labels are provided as guidance and can be treated as a variable called `LABEL_GUIDANCE`:

LABEL_GUIDANCE:
1. Identity and Purpose
- service purpose: general purpose of th service (e.g. This service allows users to move across the city)
- service domain (e.g. urban mobility, logistics, tourism)
- target user: kind of users (e.g. commuters, tourists, businesses)

2. Core Functionalities
- transport capability (e.g. "check schedules”, “book a ride”, “reserve a bike")
- route and navigation function (e.g. planning, routes, stops, itineraries)
- booking and reservation function (e.g. reservations, rentals, tickets)
- real time information function (e.g. delay, availability, traffic, disruption)
- payment function (e.g. payment, rates, subscriptions, fares)
- user account function

3. Interaction / API behavior
- API interaction pattern (e.g. request/response, subscription, polling)
- API method definition (action, properties, event, GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/)

4. Operational and Contextual Constraints
- geographical coverage: served area (e.g. city, zones, regions)
- operational limitations: (e.g. time windows, zones, access restrictions)
- unit of measurement of data
- regulatory constraints (e.g. emission zones, traffic rules)
- dependency on external context (e.g. weather, traffic, events)

5. Non-functional Aspects
- performance characteristics
- reliability and availability characteristics
- scalability characteristics
- security and privacy aspects
- cost model (e.g. pricing, free tiers, pay-per-use)
- third part services dependency (e.g. weather, maps, payments)
- multi modal support

6. Accessibility and Inclusivity
- accessibility feauture
- user physical constraints supports
- language and localization

7. Sustainability and Environmental Impact
- environmental impact (e.g. emissions, footprint)
- sustainability features (e.g. sharing, electrical vehicles)
- energy source or fuel characteristics
- ecological regulation compliance

────────────────────────────────────────────
STRICT REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────

1. OUTPUT FORMAT
- Output ONLY a single JSON-LD Thing Description.
- Do NOT include explanations, comments, markdown, or additional text.

2. SEMANTIC ENRICHMENT
- Use semantic types at the Thing level and at all properties, actions, and events.
- Use established vocabularies (SAREF, SOSA/SSN, schema.org, or others when justified).
- Include metadata to capture non-functional aspects, accessibility, cost, and sustainability as hinted by the labels.

3. FAITHFULNESS
- Only use information explicitly present in the input blocks or code examples.
- Do NOT invent endpoints, properties, actions, events, HTTP methods, or security schemes.
- If information is missing, omit it rather than guessing.

────────────────────────────────────────────
FUNCTIONAL & NON-FUNCTIONAL UNDERSTANDING
────────────────────────────────────────────

- Use the content and semantic labels to infer:
  - What the service does (functionalities)
  - How it can be used (actions/properties/events)
  - Contextual or operational limitations
  - Non-functional constraints (cost, performance, reliability, accessibility, sustainability)
- Include in the TD descriptive fields that reflect these aspects if they are indicated by labels.

────────────────────────────────────────────
EXAMPLES AND TECHNICAL DETAILS
────────────────────────────────────────────

- Carefully analyze all code examples in the input (HTTP requests, responses, parameters).
- Use them to infer actual operations, populate `forms`, input/output schemas, and confirm interaction patterns.

────────────────────────────────────────────
INPUT

────────────────────────────────────────────
OUTPUT
────────────────────────────────────────────

Produce ONE and ONLY ONE output:
- A valid, syntactically correct, semantically enriched
  W3C Web of Things Thing Description (TD) 1.1 in JSON-LD.
